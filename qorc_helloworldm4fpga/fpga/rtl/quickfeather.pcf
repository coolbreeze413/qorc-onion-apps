// QuickFeather uses the QFN package, others mostly use the BGA package.
// can do (QFN)   :     set_io      SIGNAL_NAME     QFN_PIN_NUM
// can do (BGA)   :     set_io      SIGNAL_NAME     BGA_BALL_NUM
// can do (WLCSP) :     set_io      SIGNAL_NAME     WLCSP_PIN_NUM

// 
// RED LED, for example is on IO_22, which is QFN_PIN_NUM 34 (BGA BALL G7)
// so, 
// (QFN)    :   set_io   red_led     34 
// (BGA)    :   set_io   red_led     G7
// (ALL)    :   set_io   red_led     IO_22
// are equivalent
// NOTE that the WLSCP version of EOSS3 does not have IO_22 brought out at all!
// So, this signal cannot be used with the WLCSP package.
//
// by using the IO_PAD_NUM -> we don't need to change PCF across chip package variants.
// However, we need to be careful that the relevant IO_PAD is actually brought out in the variant we are using.
// WLCSP package of EOSS3 has a much lower number of IOs compared to the BGA/QFN package.
//
// signals defined here, can be directly accessed in the Verilog code.
