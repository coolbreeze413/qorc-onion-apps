// ROUGH NOTES and ideas
// adapted from : https://github.com/defano/digital-design

// adapt the pwm technique to vary the duty-cycle in a pattern of increase-peak-decrease
// to achieve a "breathing" effect.
// approx 60Hz is good for a change in the BREATHE_o brightness for visual appeal to the human eye.

// Theory of operation:
//
// LED brightness can be achieved by rapidly turning on and off the LED; the
// longer we leave the LED on, the brighter it will appear. So long as we
// "flash" the LED at a high rate, this will be imperceptable to the human
// eye. This circuit uses a 256 clock-cycle period in which *a varying fraction*
// of that period the LED is on. 
//
// To create a breathing effect, we slowly modulate the brightness level, first
// increasing it until it reaches 100%, then slowly decreasing it.
//
// |MIN| | <---------- INHALE ----------> | MAX | <---------- EXHALE ----------> | |MIN|
// | <----------------------------------- COUNTER -----------------------------------> |
// | <--- 256 ---> || <--- 256 ---> || <--- 256 ---> || <--- 256 ---> || <--- 256 ---> |
// | ON |   OFF    ||  ON   |  OFF  ||    ON     |OFF||  ON   |  OFF  || ON |   OFF    |
// | inhale period, increasing on period  |      | exhale period, decreasing on period |
//
// step-counter -> will be used to mark the start of a step-period (1/60 sec)
// at each step mark, the step-period-counter start running and run for 256 clock cycles.
// at each step, the duty-cycle will be incremented from zero to 255, rollover to zero 
// and upto 255 again.
// each time duty-cycle reaches 256, we toggle between inhale and exhale mode.

// step-counter 
//    -> trigger step-period-counter -> duty-counter running
//    -> trigger duty-cycle-increment
//    -> && duty-cycle reaches max -> toggle inhale mode
//    
// at each clk -> check mode, duty-cycle, duty-counter and set the BREATHE_o on or off.
// if (inhale), BREATHE_o is ON as long as (duty-counter < duty-cycle (duty-cycle is increasing)
// if (exhale), BREATHE_o is ON as long as duty-counter > duty-cycle (duty-cycle is decreasing)

// next_ctr -> triggers duty cycle change, happens every "period" cycles (24-bits)
// at each next_ctr, duty cycle changes by 1, and we need 0 - 0xff - 0 for inhale-exhale
// so, duty_cycle sets = 256x2 = 512.

// if period cycles = 0x10000 (0x10000 cycles at each brightness level in inhale+exhale)
// then one inhale-exhale = 0x10000 * 512 = 65536 * 512 = 33 554 432 clocks or 0x2000000 clocks.
// with 8-bit pwm, 12MHz input clock, 0x10000 cycle period per duty-cycle will give 
// an approximately human breathing cycle appearance ~3seconds.


// FUTURE REIMPLEMENTATION NOTES =========================================================
// 256 clock cycle is a single unit -> PWM with PWM_RESOLUTION_BITS = 8 -> single PWM cycle
// duty_cycle_tick -> goes from 0 - 255 and repeats back from 0 (because 8 bits)

// each PWM cycle, we increment a counter so that we have a pwm_cycle_tick
// every N-PWM cycles, we change the duty_cycle from 0 - 255 - 0 in steps of 1
// it doesn't make sense to have too big N, so we keep max N = 256, min N = 2, and N is always a power of 2 for simple implementation
// pwm_cycle_tick[0] will toggle every cycle, so every 2 (or 2^N cycles with higher bits of pwm_cycle_tick) - we can kickoff change in duty_cycle

// so, duty_cyle[7:0] (PWM_RESOLUTION_BITS-1:0) we increment as a counter, at every pwm_cycle_tick[N] (N=0to7)

// this much alone would give us a breathing effect.

// now, the challenge would be to exactly give one inhale-exhale cycle (or multiples of).
// this can be left to the top level module who uses us, to stop us at appropriate clock cycles.
// so how many clock cycles for one inhale - exhale cycle?
// pwm-cycle = 256 clock cycles
// (N=0) every 2x pwm-cycle, we have duty_cycle move 1 step so 512 clock cycles for each duty-cycle
// duty-cycle goes 0 - 255 - 0 , so 512 steps per inhale-exhale cycle
// so 512x512 clock cycles per inhale-exhale cycle. = 262144 clock cycles
// basically, we need calculation (N-pwm cycles x 512) == 1 inhale-exhale period == 1 second for example.
// 2x256 x 512 == 1 second, so clock_freq = 262144 262.144kHz, so for
