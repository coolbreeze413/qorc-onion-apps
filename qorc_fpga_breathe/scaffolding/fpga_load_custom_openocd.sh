# the generated .openocd script only focusses on loading the design and setting the IOMUX
#  registers for the design - it does not do anything related to initialization of the EOS_S3
# typically, we need to ensure that the EOS_S3 has been reset before loading the design.

# also, the script is generated with the expectation that it will be run from the gdb interface
# so the target is already defined while running, for example, the 'mww' commands.
# To run this directly, the target must be specified - in our case, the target is 'eos_s3.cpu', as 
# defined in the scripts/targets/eos_s3.cfg in openocd 

# we will customize a new openocd script on the fly and then use it.
# we can add steps BEFORE and AFTER the load-fpga-design script
# we will also add the '_TARGETNAME' in front of all commands that need it.
